## The whole cachematrix.R would first cache the 
##inverse of a matrix, and then return the inverse back
##to the original matrix.

## makeCacheMatrix would create a matrix 
##that can cache its inverse

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## cacheSolve would compute the inverse 
##of the matrix returned by makeCacheMatrix

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
